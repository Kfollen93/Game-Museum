You can download the game from my Itch.io page here: <a href="https://kfollen.itch.io/game-museum-inspector">Game Museum Inspector</a>. <br>


<i>*This is brief repository containing only the scripts and scriptable objects to be used as a code reference resource. </i> <br>

## Description
Game Museum Inspector contains exhibits of various game consoles where you can zoom in and inspect the 3d models, along with interacting with the exhibit to learn about the specific console.

## Development
This was less of a "game" and more of a project for myself to solidify my understanding of events and to rely less on poor habits such as using the `Update` loop to constantly poll for input/interactions, `FindWithTag`, and so on. This project uses the new input system and is set up for keyboard/mouse along with controller. The majority of the code is focused around events using `EventHandler` to prompt interact options, and to get the Scriptable Object data that's associated with each exhibit. Additionally, I made this project in Unity HDRP and wanted to include graphic settings (specifically implementing Ray Tracing) so there are graphic options to choose from Low - Max Ray Tracing.<br>
<br>
This project took me roughly 3-4 weeks to complete, while working a full time job. I used Trello to plan and track my tasks.
